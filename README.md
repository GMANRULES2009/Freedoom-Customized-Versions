# Freedoom-Customized-Versions
These are versions of Freedoom Phase 1 , 2 and Deathmatch map set "FreeDM" with My personal favorite sprites &amp; sounds as well as some customized and or custom sprites , maps (See Phase 2's Maps 31 &amp; 32)  and even some Midi tracks (See Map 30 in Phase 2.) Like official builds these too work as IWADS , can be used on all ports and can load any PWADS
